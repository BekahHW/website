  Learn about assets in Theatre.js

Theatre.js assets let you keyframe files in props so that you can keyframe them along with the rest of your animation.
Right now the only asset prop Theatre.js supports is the `types.image` prop.

To get started with assets, decide on a location you are going to host them at (like `/theatrejs-assets`, or a CDN of your choice),
then let Theatre.js know about it when creating a project.

```ts
const project = getProject('My project', {
  assets: {
    baseUrl: '/theatrejs-assets',
  },
})
```

Theatre.js will then look for assets at this location. If you don't specify it, it'll default to the value `'/'`.

To use an asset prop, define it in a `sheet.object()` call.

```ts
const object = sheet.object('My Object', {
  texture: types.image('', {
    label: 'Texture',
  }),
})
```

Studio lets you assign files to asset props, which it will initially store in IndexedDB.

If any assets are used in your project, upon exporting the project, you also get a zip file with all the assets,
which you need to extract to the location specified in `projectConfig.assets.baseUrl`.
As soon as an asset is found at this location, it is deleted from IndexedDB to free up space.

The values of asset props are asset handles, which you can use to retrieve the URL for that asset using [`Project.getAssetUrl()`](/docs/latest/api/core#project.getasseturl_assethandle_).

```ts
const object = sheet.object('My Object', {
  texture: types.image(undefined, {
    label: 'Texture',
  }),
})

object.onValuesChange(({ texture }) => {
  setImageUrl(project.getAssetUrl(texture))
})
```
